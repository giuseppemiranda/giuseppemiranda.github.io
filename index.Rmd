## About me

---

#### Hello! I’m Giuseppe. I'm a recent graduate of the cognition and neuroscience PhD program at UT Dallas. Here, studied the role of dopamine, brain structure and lifestyle factors in aging and cognitive performance. I have a strong interest in Alzheimer's disease and an interest in how we can improve our healthspan and quality of life as we age.

#### I’m very passionate about my work and my hobbies, and I love to learn new skills.

#### I enjoy data analysis and statistics, especially when using R for my everyday lab work along with my personal interest in financial data. 

#### I like traveling, learning about different cultures and studing languages, exercising, painting and drawing, reading, blockchain tech, playing basketball, and watching my hometown Cleveland sports teams. I also love spending time with my family and friends.
