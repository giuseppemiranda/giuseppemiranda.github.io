## About me

---

#### Hello! I’m Giuseppe. I'm a postdoc at the Center for Vital Longevity @ UT Dallas. Here, I study the role of dopamine and health & lifestyle factors on cognitive and structural brain aging. I have a strong interest in how we can improve our healthspan and quality of life as we age.

#### I’m very passionate about my work and my hobbies, and I love to learn new skills.

#### The part of my career that I've enjoyed the most so far is being able to interact with my colleagues on a daily basis: talking science, collaborating on projects, and coming up with new ideas! 

#### I enjoy data analysis and statistics, especially when using R for my everyday work, along with my personal interest in finance.

#### In my free time, I enjoy traveling, learning about different cultures, and studying languages. Exercising is an important part of my everyday routine, and I also enjoy swimming and playing basketball. Some of my hobbies are painting, drawing, 3D printing, and watching my hometown Cleveland sports teams. I also love spending time with my family and friends.
