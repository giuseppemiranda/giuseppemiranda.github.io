## About me

---

#### Hello! Iâ€™m Giuseppe, and I'm a medical science liaison. I'm very passionate about my work, my hobbies, and I love to learn new skills!

#### The part of my career I've enjoyed the most is being able to interact with my colleagues on a daily basis: talking science, collaborating on projects, and coming up with new ideas! 

#### In my free time, I enjoy traveling, learning about different cultures, and studying languages. Exercising is an important part of my everyday routine, and I also enjoy playing basketball. Some of my hobbies are painting, drawing, 3D printing, and watching my hometown Cleveland sports teams. I also love spending time with my family and friends.
